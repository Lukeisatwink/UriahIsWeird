Our project was the UK data breach defense attack


This happened in May 2024


What happened was that The British Armed Forces experienced a big cyber attack believed to be caused by Chinese hackers. This attack compromised the personal data of about 270,000 serving people, reservists, and veterans.


Some things that could have helped prevent the UK data breach defense attack would be:


Stronger authentication methods such as MFA


Regular security checks


Advanced threat detection systems


They could have detected this by using intrusion detection systems and log in checks.

They could prevent a repeat by including stronger access controls and inputing more employee training.
