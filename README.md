Some things that could have helped prevent the UK data breach defense attack would be:

Stronger authentication methods such as MFA
Regular security checks
Advanced threat detection systems

They could have detected this by using intrusion detection systems and log in checks.

They could prevent a repeat by including stronger access controls and inputing more employee training.
